dsc-datatool (1.0.0-2~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 1.0.0

    This release brings a complete rewrite of the tool, from Perl to
    Python. This rewrite was made possible thanks to funding from EURid,
    and will help with maintainability and packaging.

    Core design and command line syntax is kept the same but as the
    libraries the generators use have been changed additional command line
    options must be used.

    - client_subnet_authority (generator)

      This generator now uses IANA's IP address space registry CSVs to
      look up the network authority, therefor it needs either to fetch
      the CSV files or be given them on command line.

      See `man dsc-datatool-generator client_subnet_authority` for more
      information.

    - client_subnet_country (generator)

      This generator now uses MaxMind databases to look up country based
      on subnet.

      See `man dsc-datatool generator client_subnet_country` for more
      information and setup guide of the MaxMind databases.

  * Release 0.03

    Support processing of 25 of the 37 DAT files that the Extractor
    can produce, the others can not be converted into time series data
    since they lack timestamps.  Processing of XML is the recommended
    approach to secure all information.
